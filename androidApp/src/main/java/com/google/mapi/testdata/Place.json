Had the poached egg with wine sauce then asked for the menu as I wanted to also have another starter before the main, just to experience more of the food here while in town, knowing I won’t be back too soon. Service is also amazing. Can only praise this restaurant and its staff, as well as atmosphere. Unpretentious and truly delicious.",

The house terrine was extraordinary.  Quenelle was well worth the wait as they make each fresh. Nicely prepared vegetables were a surprise accompaniment. Best Macon we have had during our visit. Ended this lovely experience with a demi Saint Marcellan and glass of Beaujolais. Highly recommended!",
